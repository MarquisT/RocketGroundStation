When the launch button is clicked again it will ask you to confirm "Has the Rocket Landed Y/N?" then stop the data if it has.

- please make the plot log the data from the rocket temperature list
- read through the communicator and see if you can figure out why we are using that
- what about making a panel above the launch button that shows current state
    - for example eventually it will says
    Temp - 18.5 C
    Air Pressure - 1012 mb
    Calculated Alt - 200 meters

- Once these are done, we will move on the altitude and pressure graphs.
