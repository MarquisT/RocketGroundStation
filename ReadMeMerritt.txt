Some quick questions:

What is the payload like?
Will we be able to retrieve the rocket ?



Quick notes on potential problems:
Pressure sensors can probably be affected by velocity;
Depending on how high the rocket goes, pressure might not noticeably change based altitude.
Temperature will also be affected by speed and engines;
Unlike a weather balloon the rocket will not be able to gather data about any particular altitude for long.
