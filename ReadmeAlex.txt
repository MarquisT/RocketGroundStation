Some questions:

What sensors does the rocket have?

How high will it go?

how will we get the info?

What kind of fuel does the rocket burn?

Notes:

I want my segment of the code to handle taking data the rocket gives us and turning it into stuff that humans can read.
I will try my best to make the output easy to understand

I will be using matplotlib to create easy to read graphs (unless anyone has a better idea)
